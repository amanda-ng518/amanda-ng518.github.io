I am an incoming M.Sc. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto. Prior to my MSc. study, I received my H.B.Sc. in Statistical Sciences (Specialist with Focus in Health Studies) and Mathematics (Major) also from the University of Toronto in 2025.

I am currently working at the Department of Statistical Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Nancy Reid.

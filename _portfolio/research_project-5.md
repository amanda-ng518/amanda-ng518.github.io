Different individuals, at various stages of
their lives, place more importance on one life
domain than another. This study generates a
set of well-being profiles according to different
combinations of aggregated elements of
well-being: purpose, community, physical, financial
and social well-being. To do this, we
used different clustering algorithms to identify
hidden clusters of individuals surveyed
from 2014â€“2017 by the Gallup U.S Daily Poll.
We tried the following clustering approaches:
Gaussian finite mixture model (GFMM) clustering,
K-means clustering, and hierarchical
clustering. We then compared the number
and characteristics of clusters given by each
approach. The study can be used to gain
more understanding of how changes in wellbeing
vary by hidden clusters in their population.
